EZ Tickets is an app made with **Flutter** framework to provide online ticket booking functionality.
**The release apk is available under the release tags. It's also available on this drive link - [EZ Tickets APK]**

## Backend
For the backend it uses a REST API made using NodeJS and MySQL. Here is the link to it's code [ez_tickets_backend]

### Important
Due to privacy and resource abuse concerns I have kept the url of the backend API private and you won't be able to see it. Therefore, if you want to work with this project and make your own edits, than you also need to deploy the backend on your own and pass the **URL** to the flutter app. 
Don't be confused, you **CAN** use my backend code provided above, you just have to deploy it on a server of your own. There are plenty of free options including:
 - Heroku
 - AWS Free Tier
 - Azure etc.

For more instruction visit the backend [README](https://github.com/arafaysaleem/ez_tickets_backend/blob/master/README.md#rocket-deployement).


Once deployed, pass the url while running the flutter app like this:

```dart
// Replace your-url-here with your own deployed URL like "https://example.com/api/v1"
flutter run --dart-define=BASE_URL="your-url-here"
```
